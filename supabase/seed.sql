EDUCATION: PhD, Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, 2008 RESEARCH INTERESTS: Speech Processing & Spoken Language Technology WORK EXPERIENCE: March 2019 – March Scientist & Tech Lead, PAII Inc., United States I work on speech recognition, language recognition, and speaker recognition. I propose L-vector and A-vector speaker embeddings with rich data augmentation methods. I show the min_DCF of 0.196 on SITW evaluation set core-core condition for 16kHz speaker recognition. I work on US, UK, non-native spoken language recognition, and Chinese accent English speech recognition. March 2018 – March Scientist, JD.com, United States I work on speaker and emotion recognition. I propose L-vector speaker embedding and achieved the actual decision cost of 0.453 in the SRE 2018 evaluation set, CMN2 telephone speech including 2,063,007 trials. I show an act_DCF of 0.393 with the K-fold cross-validation score fusion of 6 systems. I implement MFCC_GMM and Low-Level-Descriptors_SVM systems for speech emotion, natural vs. anger, recognition and showed 85.36%UAR on the IEMOCAP database. October 2017 – March Sr. Scientist, Tencent, China I work on speaker verification by using the DNN i-vector approach in 8kHz speech. I show 4.9%EER on 262,196 trials with 2,595 Chinese speakers and had 3.9%EER in 16kHz speech based on the same dataset. To know the effect of language mismatch, I show results of 4.9%EER on Chinese training and 5.3%EER on English training for the Chinese target language. November 2015 – October Scientist & Special Asst. to CTO, Voicebox Technologies, United States We are the vendor of Toyota in North American providing speech recognition applications in the car. I focus on improving speech recognition. Data parallelism is implemented using multiple GPUs and Torch for large-scale learning and to reduce training time. It shows about 4 times faster than a single GPU when using 6 GPUs. The accuracy of multiple GPUs is comparable with the single GPU. Multilingual information, English, French, Italian, is applied to pre-train neural networks and shows better performance. January 2015 – November Technical Section Manager, Delta Electronics, Taiwan I spend effort on developing Chinese-English mixed language speech recognition and show more than a 10% error rate reduction using DNN including  MPE-DNN acoustic model training;  mixed language speech;  DNN-based speaker adaptation;  data selection. I involve in capturing the YouTube video caption using OCR to collect more available speech and text data for training the acoustic model. Also, I involve in object detection using Arduino and ultrasound modules. June 2014 – January Sr. Engineer, MediaTek, Taiwan I develop the speech command control for the mobile camera application. For example, we can say CAPTURE or CHEESE to take a picture. I involve in Android programming, Google cloud, indoor navigation using WiFi as a positioning, ultrasonic gesture recognition, and Android system integration. August 2011 – June Researcher, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan I do research and implementation of speech recognition, speaker recognition, and spoken document retrieval. I achieve the 1st position in IWSLT 2013 speech recognition evaluation campaign. I support speech recognition in the project of speech to speech translation APP which is available online: VoiceTra. February 2009 – August Scientist, Institute for Infocomm Research, A-Star, Singapore I conduct research on speaker and speech recognition. I implement the use of JFA and i-vector for speaker recognition systems. I involve in many projects including the social robotics project, voice control TV, speaker verification, and language recognition. I show good results in attending the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, speaker recognition evaluation, SRE. August 2008 – February Sr. Software Engineer, Gorilla Technology, Taiwan I build telephone-based speaker recognition and keyword spotting systems for the project of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, CIB. June 2004 – July Ph.D. Research Work, Taiwan I explore English and Mandarin mixed-language speech recognition. I investigate the construction of a robust English and Mandarin phone set. The efficient multilingual phone set is determined based on the acoustic and contextual analysis. Furthermore, I propose a novel approach to spoken document retrieval. The multi-level knowledge indexing is used for spoken document indexing based on the transcription data, keywords extracted from spoken documents, and hypernyms of the extracted keywords. The semantic verification approach is utilized to re-rank retrieved documents to improve search results.

Educational background includes a masters and an undergrad electrical engineering degree in signal processing. Professional Work Experience Senior Principal Design Engineer – Cadence Design Systems, San Jose, CA, July 2016 onwards I have been working with the Tensilica group of Cadence since July 2016. In the past, I worked on developing 5G algorithms in Matlab and C. At present, I am working with the architecture group on enhancing and improving Tensilica processors. Senior Algorithm Engineer - Audience Inc (now Knowles), Mountain View, CA, May 2014 – May 2016 I worked on customizing and optimizing Speaker dependent and independent Voice Wake Up solutions for mobile and IoT devices. My job involved training and tuning of acoustic models in multiple languages, integrating new algorithms in the existing system, debugging and fixing performance issues in products shipped to OEM vendors. These Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are performance optimized in terms of low false rejection rate (FRR) and false acceptance rate (FAR). I also wrote scripts in Matlab, Perl, Python for tasks around many Voice solutions. Work with code bases in Java, C, C++, Matlab. Speech Intern - Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, California, June 2013 - Jan 2014 This internship was with Speech group for seven months. My job required evaluating ASR based solutions for local languages of India by different 3rd parties, for their recognition accuracy, word error rate (WER). I also carried out performance evaluation of Intel’s voice assistant solution that used Nuance Speech Recognition engine. Senior Project Engineer - Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, July 2009 - Oct 2011 In this role, I developed Speech Recognition system using CMU''s Sphinx decoder in Hindi language to automate two applications: roll number based course registration for academic use, and crop name based information retrieval for agricultural aid. Wrote applications in Perl using MySQL Database and Sphinx ASR solution to manage and automate manual transcription process. Customized frontend and tuned acoustic models for a medium vocabulary application using automatic speech recognition. Principal Engineer - Quadio Devices, Pune, India, Nov 2011 - May 2012 While working with Quadio, my tasks mostly comprised of evaluating different noise cancellation solutions for single channel hearing aids. Also converted Matlab code to reference C floating point and fixed point equivalent C code. This development was done in Visual Studio in Windows environment Multimedia Architect - Freescale Semiconductors, Bangalore, India, Jan 2007 - Apr 2009 With Freescale, I worked as multimedia architect for audio/speech solutions’ requirements for mobile platforms. I learnt fundamentals of audio architectures such as ALSA, and Dev Sound during this course. I also helped with fixing quality issues faced with audio & speech codec solutions on Freescale platforms. Applications Architect - InterVideo India, Bangalore, India, Sep 2005 – Dec 2006 In this role, I had the opportunity to design and develop DVBH and 1Seg Digital TV application on OMAP2420 and OMAP2430 platforms. I was also leading a team for integration of audio codecs for camcorder applications by InterVideo. Senior Software Engineer – Sasken Communications, Bangalore, India, Apr 1999 – Sep 2005 In Sasken, I worked on improving Perceptual Quality of JS/IS streams of MPEG2 Layer3 for a mobile solution used in NEC devices. To recognize this effort, my team was awarded the best team award in 2002. I also designed an application to handle audio and video encoding and decoding for H.324 Video Phone. Prior to this, I also developed floating point and fixed-point C reference code for MPEG-4 CELP codecs, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AAC LC decoder. Project Associate – Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, Nov 1997 – Mar 1999 Developed C code using Visual Studio for low (2.4kbps) and very low (1.2kbps) MBE speech coder and decoder. Also designed a post-filter to improve perceptual quality of decoded speech.

WORK EXPERIENCE IN MICROSOFT Principal Data Science Manager – Data and Insights team (2019-present) o Data pipeline for ground truth tagging Lead engineering team to build and maintaining the data pipeline where > 1TB data is used for training and evaluations daily. Responsible for large-scale e2e pipeline involving sampling, transcription, ingestion, storage, and API access. Improved sharding so our 750 speech-hour dataset evaluation improved from 12 to 2 hours. o Partner support: First point of contact for 1P and 3P partners for speech accuracy. Frequently visit customers to train them on building speech apps, channel their feedback to our internal team, work with data team to ingest their data and work with sales team to provide the right data to win the deal . o Fairness evaluation: Work with Ethics in AI committee to provide the fairness report to ensure our Speech services do well for all types of speakers. Collect data, evaluate our models, and provide simple distribution report. Built DataSheets for our datasets so we can quickly check for bias in datasets. o Product dashboards: Lead data science and engineering team to build and maintain dashboard measuring speech accuracy of all our 1P products providing trendlines, problematic phrases and anomaly detection. Data pipeline of sampling, annotation and analysis completes within 8 hours. Principal Data Science Lead – Speech Infrastructure (2018-2019) o SpeeDME infrastructure: Own insights service which provides high level metrics, pre-built insights, and access to deeper insights via azure notebooks on evaluation results - offline, service, product logs and competition results. User can get the top 3 areas of improvements within 10 minutes. o Competition evaluation: Own the main pipeline which tests Microsoft 3P service vs. competition. Use a combination of both internal and public sets to ensure the data is not biased. Provided key insights which helped our scientists build the first 3P model which performs better than Google. Report shared quarterly up to C-level executives. Senior Data Scientist – HoloLens (2016-2018) o Built the very first HoloLens org-wide dashboard (mROC) to track all features for Oasis. Worked with the 7 data engineers and 18 PMs to build the e2e pipeline churning 10 TBs of data daily. Dashboard with 72 tiles was used in daily LT meetings to track product health. o Build data pipeline for speech engagement and accuracy metrics, used by VP reviews for product planning. o Part of the team which implemented the See it Say it mode for hololens . Provided SDKs and tools to developers to improve the design of product for better speech accuracy. o Worked on the Dictation with commands feature on hololens where users could use hands free mode to start dictation, provide punctuations and send messages. Senior Data Scientist – Xbox (2012-2016) o Primary data analyst, started at incubation stage working with research team and then with product team up to the launch of Xbox Kinect and Xbox One. o Combined service logs, annotated data, and client telemetry to find a critical bug in our design which improved user accuracy from 67% to 92%. o Shipped tools as part of SDK to help developers build better speech experience. It would automatically recommend problematic phrases, alternate pronunciations, grammar tuning , confidence tuning to improve user experience. Software developer in Test – Speech Modeling team (2007-2013) o (Microsoft did not have a formal Data Scientist / Data Engineer title, so we came under SDET analysis team) o Built the first main data and insights pipeline used by scientists analyzing speech models that shipped from Speech @ Microsoft. o Worked on Exchange Voice Mail Preview, Office Communication Services SDKs.

At Qualcomm I worked on the Zeroth processor and Neural Processing Unit (NPU). My research work on machine learning and deep learning models is part of the current generation of the Snapdragon processors and the Qualcomm wearable processors. Selected projects are: 1. Lead for RNN and LSTM network design: I was the lead and owner of the project from requirement specification to productization. This included data collection, pre-processing, building the data pipeline, model development and model delivery to the product teams. The project involved development of an ultra-low complexity RNN and LSTM network with custom loss designs. The model enabled extending the battery life of a mobile device. The first milestone of this project is part of the current generation of Qualcomm processors. (Team Size: 4.5 and 1 intern) 2. Embedded System for Machine Learning: Part of a 4-member core team that mapped C++/C compute microkernels (for voice activation and hot word recognition using MFCC and GMM based approach) onto a new hardware accelerator for high performance. This involves parallelizing C++ kernels for optimum use of memory using the underlying ISA and profiling these through simulation. The profiling data is used to characterize performance of the architecture for micro-architecture improvements and enhancing the audio codec and algorithms. This project was commercialized and is part of the Qualcomm Wearable series of processors. 3. Deep Learning model development: I was part of an exploratory team working on multi-modal deep learning network design for visual question answering. This included designing low complexity deep neural network architecture for scene recognition along with recurrent neural network for sentiment analysis. Tools used: Keras/TensorFlow and Python. 4. Lead for LSTM design on NPU: Led the effort to optimize and deploy LSTMs on Qualcomm’s NPU accelerator. This included performance optimizations, including memory bandwidth and computation, for executing Recurrent neural network using LSTM and convolutional layers. Network was designed in Keras for a sample application and then optimized at the micro kernel level like GPU optimizations. (Team Size: 2) 5. Signal Processing/Machine Learning: Novel face recognition feature extraction algorithm development for computer vision applications. The algorithm was developed for a new kind of sparse sampling imager. The algorithm was tied to support vector machine based classifier for facial recognition. Since the underlying math for sparse sampling does not exist we had to develop that math and filed a few patents related to this. Also, had the opportunity to give a demo and presentation to the Qualcomm Executive team (CEO, CTO, CFO and the Executive VPs). Language used were python and Matlab. 6. Software design: Backend tools regression setup and management using Python and c-shell scripts. Abstracting and automating various scripts at Qualcomm. The automation was done in a manner so that all the entire tool chain could be run as a single push- button script. Parsers were developed for determining whether a tool ran successfully and accordingly remove the subsequent jobs from the queue. 7. Computational Neuroscience: Sparse feature learning using multi-layer spiking neural networks. The patterns were sparse music patterns (RIFF codes) embedded in severe noise. These networks were very similar to the song- bird recognition networks. Development of these networks also required developing a very elaborate stimulus generator in python. The networks were developed in in-house network description language. 8. Statistical Signal Processing: Led a team for exploring inference based probabilistic algorithm implementation using stochastic hardware. Developed the project proposal and proposed this project to the Qualcomm R&D  of 3 Manu Rastogi CV (ML_061020-21) leadership. Worked on implementing machine learning algorithms using stochastic hardware. Developed python libraries and simulated transistor based circuits running on ultra-low supply voltages such that they could act as stochastic hardware substrate. (Team Size: 4) • Research Assistant Computational Neuro-Engineering Laboratory (CNEL), University of Florida, Gainesville May 2007-May 2012 Research work focused on developing circuits and networks inspired from computational neuroscience. As part of my research work, I designed and used silicon neurons as time-based data encoders or asynchronous analog-to-digital converters. One of the applications was neural signal recording where the action potential is converted into asynchronous spike trains, resulting in significant bandwidth reduction. Over the course of my PhD I designed and taped-out about 20 chips with an emphasis on ultra-low power circuits. Modeled and contributed to theory of bench marking these irregular samplers. I also contributed to the development efforts at my lab to build a configurable spiking network architecture. These architectures were used for phoneme recognition using liquid state machines and reservoir computing. One such contribution was developing a real-time system of recording audio data from the sound card and applying gamma- tone cochlear filters (DSP algorithms) and the Meddis hair cell model in Java and C++. I was very fortunate to get the opportunity to attend the "Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop" in 2008. The workshop is invite only and only 20-30 participants are selected from world-over. As part of my projects there I worked on the java-based API jAER to drive a car using the spike inputs from the silicon retina. For this work I was named the "Most promising Neuromorphic researcher of the year" Selected Publications • Manu Rastogi, Alexander Singh Alvarado , John G. Harris , JC Principe .
